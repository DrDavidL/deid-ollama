    "# Parallel De-identification with Ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a guide to de-identifying data in parallel using Ollama. It offers several approaches to manage concurrent requests to the Ollama API, ensuring robust and efficient processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Select an Implementation Approach:**\n",
    "You can choose the implementation approach by setting the `IMPLEMENTATION_APPROACH` variable in the **Configuration** section below. The default is `'semaphore'`, which is a reliable and performant option for most use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting Guidance:**\n",
    "If you experience issues such as timeouts or connection errors, you can adjust the settings in the **Configuration** section. Here are some specific recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Reduce `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`**: Start by lowering this value to `2` or `1`. This will significantly reduce the load on the Ollama server.\n",
    "2.  **Try the `queue` approach**: If reducing concurrent requests doesn't solve the issue, change the `IMPLEMENTATION_APPROACH` to `'queue'`. This can provide more stability in some environments.\n",
    "3.  **Increase `MAX_RETRIES`**: If you are still seeing occasional errors, you can increase the `MAX_RETRIES` value to `5` or `6` to give the script more chances to succeed."

    "\n",
    "### Semaphore-based Approach\n",
    "A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that controls access to a shared resource. In this context, it limits the number of concurrent API calls to Ollama. This is a simple and effective way to prevent overloading the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate Limiting Approach\n",
    "Rate limiting controls the number of requests sent to the API within a specific time period. This approach is useful for APIs that have a strict rate limit policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queue-based Approach\n",
    "A queue-based approach provides a more controlled way of processing the data. Requests are added to a queue and processed by a pool of workers. This ensures that the number of concurrent requests never exceeds the specified limit and provides a buffer for incoming requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Pool Approach\n",
    "This approach uses a pool of processes to execute the de-identification tasks in parallel. It can be more efficient for CPU-bound tasks, as it leverages multiple CPU cores."
